How to compile
--------------

### On Debian GNU/Linux (and derivatives)

1.  Check to make sure you have OpenSSL installed (as root):

        sudo aptitude install libssl-dev openssl

2.  Build the software (doesn't need root):

        make

### On Android (Mobile, ARM)

1.  Navigate to `svpn/android/jni`:

        cd android/jni

2.  Decompress the pre-built libssl and libcrypto binaries:

        gunzip -c libcrypto.a.gz > libcrypto.a
        gnuzip -c libssl.a.gz > libssl.a

3.  Run the included helper setup script to download the openssl headers:

        ./setup.sh

4.  Use ndk-build (assuming it in your path) to build the application:

        ndk-build

How to run
